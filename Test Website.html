<p> I recently purchased a 2017 Civic type R in Rally Red, my first red car! I am in absolutely awe regarding this car. Its so amazingly fast and nimble. The price tag of the car from the factory is 35,000 USD, however a lot of dealers have previously marked these cars up.</p>

<p>The really neat thing about this car is the way that it handles. Within the car itself is adjustable suspension to adapt how you want to drive. You can make the suspension as soft as it could be, stiff, or just sporty. I will say the track mode does an amazing job at making the suspension stiff. Its really a rough ride. The above image of the red Honda badge symbolizes the type R, which is really neat.</p>

<p>The Honda Civic comes in a multitude of colors, ranging from a beautiful blue color, red, yellow, white, black, and metallic green. The interior is decked out in alcantera and carbon fiber.</p>

<p> There are a numerous amount of upgrades that this car can potentially have. Ranging from engine, exhaust and also interior modifications. I myself have already upgraded a couple of things, including the original shifter. I do have a banner for the windshield, however I haven't placed it on the car yet.

<p> There was one other really cool type R I really wanted previously but it wasn't released in the US. The FK-2 Type R, which is similar to my fk-8 Type R.</p>
